# Tic-Tac-Toe

HELLO HELLO! 
Welcome to another one of my projects! In this project I created a simple tic-tac-toe game that can be ran on your local computer (both singleplayer and multiplayer).

The point of this project was to teach me the basics of web development (Responsive Design, Javascript, HTML, CSS, etc).

The multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game can be played with a friend, family member, or anyone you'd like to play against. I made sure to make the UI as pretty as possibe so that players don't have a hard time trying to figure out who is who :P

If Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game, what happens if you don't have someone to play with... **YOU'RE IN LUCK MY FRIEND!**

I made sure to create a single-player version where you play against an AI which I developed using the minmax algorithm (hehehehehe)

**ENJOY THE GAME AND HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!!!**
